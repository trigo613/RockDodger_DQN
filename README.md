# DQN Agent Trained to Play a Custom Game

This project trains a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent using visual input only to play a small custom game created at the beginning of the notebook.

## Training Results

The agent's progress throughout the training process is shown in the video below.

## How it Works

The DQN agent is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to process the visual input of the game environment. Over time, the agent learns to optimize its actions and improve its performance in the game.
